## My process

- My process of creating this solution began with the use of semantic HTML, ensuring a clean and structured codebase by applying the appropriate tags according to semantic HTML principles. Next, I wrote the CSS following the guidelines outlined in the proposed challenge. Finally, I adapted the CSS to ensure responsiveness for smaller screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties

- The following semantic HTML tags were used in this project:

     `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<link>`, `<footer>`
     `<body>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`  
     `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<b>`, `<img>`, `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`  

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce the importance of semantic HTML in structuring content effectively. I also applied CSS best practices to style the page in a clean and accessible way.


### Continued development

My short-term goal is to create web pages using semantic HTML and advanced CSS techniques to enhance structure and responsiveness.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) - This guide helped me understand the importance of semantic elements.
