## My process

- My process of creating this solution began with the use of semantic HTML, ensuring a clean and structured codebase by applying the appropriate tags according to semantic HTML principles. Next, I wrote the CSS following the guidelines outlined in the proposed challenge. Finally, I adapted the CSS to ensure responsiveness for smaller screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties

- The following semantic HTML tags were used in this project:

     `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<link>`, `<footer>`\
     `<body>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>` <br>
     `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<b>`, `<img>`, `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`  

#### @import
The `@import` rule in CSS allows you to import external fonts, such as from Google Fonts, via a link in your style sheet.

#### Selectors
- `*`: Selects all elements.
- `#id`: Selects an element by its ID.
- `.class`: Selects elements by their class.

#### Pseudo-elements
- `::marker`: Selects the markers of list items.

#### Pseudo-classes
- `:first-child` and `:last-child`: The `:first-child` and `:last-child` pseudo-classes match a specified element that is the first child or last child of another element.
- `:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type`: Select the first or last element of its type among a group of sibling elements.
- `:hover`: Selects the element on mouse over.
- `:not()`: Selects any element that is not the element specified in the parentheses.

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce the importance of semantic HTML in structuring content effectively. I also applied CSS best practices to style the page in a clean and accessible way.


### Continued development

My short-term goal is to create web pages using semantic HTML and advanced CSS techniques to enhance structure and responsiveness.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) - This guide helped me understand the importance of semantic elements.
